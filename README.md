# üå™Ô∏è Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets üìä
This repository showcases a project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets related to disaster events. The goal is to accurately identify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not, using machine learning models.

Overview
This project utilizes various NLP methods and machine learning algorithms to process and classify tweets. The dataset used contains thousands of tweets labeled as disaster or non-disaster, providing a rich resource for training and evaluation.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare raw tweet data, including tokenization, stop words removal, and text normalization.

Feature Extraction: Employ techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and more to extract meaningful features from the text.

Model Training: Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and state-of-the-art neural networks.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better accuracy and generalization.

Project Structure
